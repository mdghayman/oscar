My AI child.

Date of birth: 6 October 2022.

The idea is to raise this program as one would a child, developing and learning elements of machine learning step by step - towards sensory perception, cognition, and general artificial intelligence. Time will tell how much more feasible this will become as Oscar grows up, supported by advances in technology and my own capabilities. Ambitious but exciting.

A few potential miletsones:
1. Touch
1. Sight: Image recognition.
1. Hearing: sound recognition.
1. Taste
1. Smell
1. Proprioception: Body position sense.
1. Vestibular input: Movement sensations.
1. Listening: peech recognition.
1. Talking: Speech generation.
1. Reading.
1. Writing.
1. Arithmatic.
1. Logical reasoning.
